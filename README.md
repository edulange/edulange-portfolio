## Skills and Best Practices Utilized

- Usage of descriptive classes and IDs to enhance code understanding and maintainability.
- Implementation of semantic elements such as "header," "nav," "main," "section," and "footer" to improve content structure and accessibility.
- Adoption of font icons (Font Awesome, Material Icons, etc.) instead of images to optimize performance and styling of icons.
- Fully responsive design ensuring a consistent experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Opening external links in new tabs/windows using the "target='_blank'" attribute.
- Inclusion of concise comments in the code to explain the purpose of specific sections.
- Separation of CSS into an external file ("styles.css") to keep HTML structure and CSS style separate.
- Utilization of SVG files for images, providing scalability and improved quality across different resolutions.
